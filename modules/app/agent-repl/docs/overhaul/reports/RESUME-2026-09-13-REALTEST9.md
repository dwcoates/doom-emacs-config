# Resume file: bring realtest 9 home (written 2026-09-13 22:00, before a compaction)

Read this first after compaction. Then read `docs/REMEDIATION-CHANGELOG.md`
(regression watch), the tail of `docs/REALTEST-JUDGEMENT-CALLS.md` (every
ruling of 2026-09-13), `docs/REALTEST-PLAN.md` "Status", and
`docs/FOOTER-TOPOLOGY-AUDIT.md`.

## Standing orders in force

- Realtest 9 and the Conversation section: the lead authors, runs and
  remediates to completion WITHOUT the owner. Corrective UI changes only.
- Zero warnings/errors in any system's log; "pre-existing" is not a
  category; the gap scan between sweeps counts.
- Diagnoses are the lead's own work; edits go to opus agents on branches
  (`git worktree add -b <branch> <scratchpad>/wt-<name> master`), merged
  `--no-ff` by the lead; doc conflicts resolved by keeping both sides.
- Only the lead runs realtests: `AGENT_REPL_REALTEST_TAKEOVER=1
  AGENT_REPL_REALTEST_STOP_DAEMON=1 bin/realtest.sh` (whole sweep) or
  `-run TestRealtest...` (one). Run in the background; read the task file.
- After every merge that changes a deployed system: `bin/deploy-all.sh`.
  The sweep DECLINES if the deployed stack is not at the checkout.
- Docker: quit gracefully (`osascript -e 'quit app "Docker"'`), never
  `pkill -9`. Sandbox Emacs layer: `e2e/sandbox/bin/e2e-sandbox.sh build`
  then `... run --dir e2e go test ./ -run TestEmacs -count=1`, then quit.
- Screen: `caffeinate -d -i -u` is running (pid 9630), screensaver idle 0,
  screenLock off. Do not rely on it after a reboot; re-check with
  `swift e2e/realtest/keydriver.swift --session` (screenLocked=no).
- Webapp gates ALWAYS include `npm run test:integration`.
- Footer fault-kind proto additions are pre-approved (reuse statuses;
  substatus buckets onto activities). Nothing profound or cross-cutting.

## State at the compaction

- master tip 501312564. Realtests 1-8 twice-green on 2026-09-13 under the
  once-per-sweep focus policy; last full sweep (rt-run33) all green with
  the gap scan down to 2 records, both the shim start contract (below).
- The owner's editor: guard-free Emacs + guard-free daemon are restored at
  every sweep end (`the owner's editor was restored` line).
- Store: schema 7, single serialized writer, read pool, ledger retention,
  no residue persisted, shape catalog (`make -C agent-shim/shim-store shapes`).

## DONE (2026-09-14 00:5x): realtest 9 twice-green, section gate passed

- rt-run40 and rt-run41 (2026-09-14 00:2x, 00:3x): realtests 1-9 all green,
  gap scan clean both times. `bin/test-all.sh` passed on every layer (Docker
  quit afterwards). Plan status row 9 updated; every fix in the changelog.
- master tip bb45b6bbc, deployed (the commits after the last deploy are
  docs and a sidecar test only).
- Realtest 10 (interrupt a running turn) AWAITS THE OWNER: no Emacs key
  interrupts a turn without a forced restart; the footer stop control is a
  webview button. See docs/REALTEST-JUDGEMENT-CALLS.md "Realtest 10, the
  interrupt key". The fake's `!hold` scenario is ready for it.
- No agents in flight. All agent worktrees removed.

## The loop for realtest 9

1. Merge the three branches above (in the order they land), deploy.
2. Run the whole sweep (1-9). Collect EVERY finding (harvest + gap scan)
   before remediating any; group by (runtime, level, operation).
3. Dispatch remediation in parallel on branches (one agent per system);
   the lead diagnoses first when a finding's cause is unclear.
4. Merge, deploy, rerun. Realtest 9 twice-green with a clean gap scan,
   1-8 still green.
5. `bin/test-all.sh` once as the section gate (Docker for the sandbox
   layer, then quit it). Update docs/REALTEST-PLAN.md status.
6. Then realtest 10 (interrupt), same loop.

## Known open items (not blocking 9)

- Footer audit rows N4 (drawn elsewhere, not footer/feed) — owner's call.
- `swept_up` lost-policy reason level (sidecar) — unruled.
- Stream-plane write-ledger rows are never pruned — unruled.
- Stale worktrees under `/private/tmp/claude-501/wt-*` and the scratchpad
  from earlier sessions; leave them.
- The gns-cowork plugin 9.10.0 ships PowerShell SessionStart hooks; they
  were stripped locally in both account roots' installed copies
  (backups `hooks.json.orig-with-powershell`); upstream still has them.
