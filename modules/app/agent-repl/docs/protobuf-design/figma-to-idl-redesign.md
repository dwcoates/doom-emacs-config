# DESIGN: the figma→idl redesign of the agent-repl contract

## The problem, in the user's terms

`frontend.v1` is the figma→idl specification for the frontend: one file per UI
component, each component's props one message, resolved by the server and
rendered verbatim. `agentrepl.v1` is the API the webapp actually talks to.
Therefore `agentrepl.v1` should be COMPOSED of `frontend.v1` messages, passed
along component-dedicated endpoints — the sidebar talks to an endpoint that
ships `frontend.v1` sidebar messages, likewise the topbar, the footer, the feed
— not a god-endpoint that handles all shapes.

That is NOT how it works today. `service AgentRepl` is a pure command surface:
34 unary RPCs, 30 of them returning an empty `Success`, none returning a
component view. With the one multiplexed push stream deleted (see the
superseded record), no `frontend.v1` component data has any path to the webapp
at all. The composition rule is nowhere in force.

The redesign walks every surface, ONE `.proto` FILE AT A TIME, in the order
`frontend.v1` → `agentrepl.v1` → `conversation.v1` → `shim.v1` → `store.v1` →
`state.v1`. For `agentrepl.v1` the RPC inventory is hashed out explicitly first,
then the shapes.

## The record this supersedes

`proto/DESIGN-protobuf-surfaces.superseded.md` is the previous design record,
kept as a backup. Every decision it records STANDS unless an entry below
reopens it by name. In particular the following are settled and are NOT
re-litigated here:

- The six surfaces and the package-boundary-is-surface-boundary rule.
- Package names encode ownership, not routing; the drawn/called test between
  `frontend` and `agentrepl`.
- `agentrepl.v1` is a Connect service, not gRPC, because of the clients (an
  xwidget WebKit view and elisp).
- Every endpoint owns its request and response, one `endpoint_` file each.
- Every response is a two-arm `oneof { success; error }`; errors are typed
  messages in band, never status codes; the async boundary keeps
  `FailureCardView` as a push.
- One canonical form per message; import the encompassing message; re-spelling
  in its four forms is a defect; depth is not synthesis.
- The one multiplexed push stream is REVERSED: one server-streaming endpoint
  per UI component, with the two surviving ordering failures (typing-cut vs
  conversation-delta; cross-stream workspace references) accepted by the user
  as the price and owed a conventions-stage answer.
